# Gitlet Design Document
Author: Darren Wang

## 1. Classes and Data Structures

The program mainly consists of the following java classes.
* `Main`
* `File`
* `Object`
* `Command`\
and
* `Diff`
* `Utils`
* `GitletException`\
which are already provided.

### a. `Main`

This class is designed as the main component of this program utilizing
all other classes to fulfill the function that the program is designed
to achieve, like version control, file submission, etc. It is basically
like the **.exe** files for Windows OS or **.app** files for MacOS if 
you are not familiar with the weird computer terminologies.

`Main` takes in your command as its input argument, and will validate 
it within the class to avoid some nonsense commands, e.g., do you like
Prof. Hilfinger, write the hw for me, etc.

### b. `File`

### c. `Object`

### d. `Command`

### e. `Diff`

### f. `Utils`

### g. `GitletException`
